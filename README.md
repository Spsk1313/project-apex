# Project Apex ðŸš€

**Project Apex** is my personal **master portfolio** â€” a monorepo containing all of my structured projects across Frontend, Backend, Systems, DevOps, and Computer Science fundamentals.

This repo is organized into **topic folders** (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Java, Spring Boot, Rust, DevOps, System Design, Clean Code, DSA, Networking).  
Each subproject has its own README with:

- ðŸ“Œ **Problem & Goals**
- âœ… **Requirements (Acceptance Criteria)**
- ðŸ§ª **How to Run / Build / Test**
- ðŸ“Š **Evidence** (benchmarks, reports, screenshots)
- ðŸ’¡ **Reflections** (what I learned)
- ðŸ”— **References**
